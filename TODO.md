# Suggestions

Update feed is notifications right?

Plain blue bg is boring? Can we do some pixel art? How about svg textures? Or dynamic gradients (The ones that
  react to your mouse movement. But I dont think it will match the site theme)

~~Settings contain only password change and acc delete options. Why not bunch them together as account settings and
  move the button to profile photo.~~
